#TITLE: Physio-ROM: Computer vision, AI Range of Motion Reports

## What is Physio ROM

## Installation

This package requires the installation and compilation of the openpose software
suite. This is detailed in the [openpose
documentation](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/tree/master/doc). The dependencies for this package are listed in requirements.txt.

Auto-setup is set up via the python virtualenv. Install python virtualenv and run the
following

=make env=
=. env/bin/activate=
=make getreqs=

## Usage

Server Usage
Start the flask server by running:
=python __main__.py=
The server side implementation has, thus far only been tested on unix systems. We
cannot guarantee. Certain linux distros may require running the code in sudo, because 
in-browser web camera streaming only functions in web ports (apparently security reasons)



Further detailed usage information is included in the doc/ folder.
