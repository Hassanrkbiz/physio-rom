# Physio-ROM: Computer vision, AI Range of Motion Reports

## What is Physio ROM

Physio ROM stands for "Automated Range of Motion (ROM) calculation for
Physiotherapists" and is an application that helps physiotherapists and their
patient to understand the range of motion of their limbs around a joint.

This is important for people that have hurt their joints or for some other
reason and cannot use their limbs to the full extent, such as after a fall,
a stroke, or an accident.

## Installation

The system consists of:
1. a Web front-end that captures the video,
2. a python based backend system to where the video is uploaded and pre-processed,
3. a C++ based computer vision system that calculates the limbs and the angles
on the limbs from the pre-processed video,
4. a Web service that serves a JSON file with the results
5. a Web page that serves the video with the results rendered and overlayed on top of the video.

The Web front end through which the video is captured can be found in the templates directory.

The python based backend system is run via the ```__main__.py``` python program.
Auto-setup is set up via the python virtualenv. Install python virtualenv and run the
following

```
make env
. env/bin/activate
make getreqs
```

The C++ based computer vision system requires the installation and compilation
of the openpose software suite. This is detailed in the [openpose
documentation](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/tree/master/doc).
The dependencies for this package are listed in requirements.txt.

## Usage

### Server Usage
Start the flask server by running:

```
python __main__.py
```

The server side implementation has, thus far only been tested on unix systems. We
cannot guarantee. Certain linux distros may require running the code in sudo, because 
in-browser web camera streaming only functions in web ports (apparently security reasons)



Further detailed usage information is included in the doc/ folder.
