#+TITLE: Physio-ROM: Computer vision, AI Range of Motion Reports

* What is Physio ROM

Physio ROM stands for "Automated Range of Motion (ROM) calculation for Physiotherapists" and is an application that helps physiotherapists and
their patient to understand the range of motion of their limbs around a
joint.

This is important for people that have hurt their joints or for some other
reason and cannot use their limbs to the full extent, such as after a fall,
a stroke, or an accident.

* Installation

The system consists of:
1. a Web front-end that captures the video,
2. a python based backend system to where the video is uploaded and pre-processed,
3. a C++ based computer vision system that calculates the limbs and the angles
on the limbs from the pre-processed video,
4. a Web service that serves a JSON file with the results
5. a Web page that serves the video with the results rendered and overlayed on top of the video.

The Web front end through which the video is captured can be found in the templates directory.
